            <h1>🎨My process:</h1>
            <p>
              This image was made using a variety of techniques. My custom
              pattern was the craters on the moon, it turned out really well
              because the moon is just small enough that you can't see an
              obvious repeat. I used the "difference" path technique on the
              little part with the zoomed in image of the moon with the American
              flag. The moon was a gray blob nd I wanted it to fit in the
              circle, so I used path > difference. I also used the exclusion
              technique on the window of the little airplane- it's very small
              and hard to see. For the airplane, eiffel tower, the earth's land,
              and the penguin, I traced out a reference image using the bezier
              curve tool. Everything else was made by hand, sometimes drawn with
              the freehand pencil tool and modified- like the rocket and the
              panama canal zoom-in. I didn't mean for it to look this fancy but
              I got carried away in creative spirits, this was very fun!
